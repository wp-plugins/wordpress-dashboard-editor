With this plugin you can remove sections of the dashboard, add new code, or even add Sidebar Widgets.

== Description ==
Of the entire website the Dashboard is seen by administrators the most, but it is the hardest part of Wordpress to customize. Well not anymore. This plugin allows you to add whatever you want to the Dashboard through PHP and HTML and allows you to even add Sidebar Widgets. You may also wipe the entire dashboard or individually remove some of the more irritating sections like the Dev news, Planet Wordpress and the getting started section.

== Installation ==
Basic Installation (If you are new to Wordpress you should probably use this.):

1. Download the zip file
1. Unzip and upload dashboard.php to your *wp-content/plugins/* folder.
1. Go to your dashboard. There will be a new sub-menu item.
1. Select any options you want and add any PHP or HTML code that you want to the textbox.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add Widgets? =
To add a sidebar widget to your dashboard (after selecting the option from the Dashboard management page) use the code:

`<?php dynamic_sidebar('admin');?>`

The Admin sidebar is modified and controlled the exact same way as any other sidebar.

= How do I display UserOnline stats from the WP-UserOnline plugin? = 
If you use the WP-UserOnline plugin you can use:
`<?php echo useronline_page();?>`

=My new content doesn't show up nicely. It is pushed to the bottom. =
If you find that your new content doesnâ€™t align nicely you can add:

     ` <div style="float:left; width:460px;">
      //
      //Add all other content here
      //
      </div>`

= Can everyone see the information I add?=
Yes, you can use User Roles ([See Wordpress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities "Visit the wordpress codex page for user roles.")). Or just use:
`
<?php if(current_user_can('edit_users')){ ?>
// Content you don't want people to see here
<?php } ?>

`
= What else can I add? =
Any code that can be used in a Wordpress Theme can be used in the dashboard.

= I'm on Wordpress 2.0, but none of the settings work. =
Unfortunately, the only way to get the plugin to work on 2.0.x is to completely wipe the dashboard.
